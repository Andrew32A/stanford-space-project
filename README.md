Note: I am unable to upload the source data because it belongs to Stanford University, the code here will not run properly without it.

# Context (Story time!)
While I was hanging out with one of my good friends, he asked if I could help his friend who was struggling with Python in her physics project at Stanford. I was immediately intrigued and agreed. We met up a week later and she showed me her project that she was stumped on for months. Despite being fairly confident in python, she was using Bokeh. I've not done any data visualization with Bokeh yet, so I told her I needed 1-2 days to study the Bokeh library and documentation. 2 days later we got together and I was able to script out the code shown in this repo. I learned a lot about data visualization and it's super awesome to be able to actually see and manipulate data that's easy on the eyes!
